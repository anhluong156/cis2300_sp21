    "*In the book \"The Most Human Human: What Talking with Computers Teaches Us About What It Means to Be Alive\", Brian Christian briefly discussed ELIZA: \"It was the first computer chat program, written in 1964 by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. Its conversational style was modeled after the Rogerian (client-centered) psychotherapy technique (which treats the client as an equal partner in figuring out their own feelings, sources of problems and solutions). ELIZA extracts key words from the user's own language, and pose their statements back to them. (\"I am unhappy...\" \"Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?\"; \"I want to/ need to....\" \"What would it mean to you if you did that?\"). If in doubt, it might fall back on some generic phrases like \"Please go on.\" or \"Tell me more\".) A rather simple program with virtually no memory, no processing power and a few hundred lines of code, ELIZA evoked a stunning response. Many of the people who first talked to ELIZA believed it was a real person talking to them and reported having had a meaningful therapeutic experience. Although its original creator was horrified by this reaction and terminated the ELIZA project, ELIZA continued to become widely known among programmers and academics. Many modern chat bots are programmed after ELIZA.\"*\n",
